# go-fundamentals-livestock-farm

Determines valuation of farm and income stream per livestock type on a farm 
WHILE using go fundamentals such as:
  - data types & operators 
 - branching/looping 
 - functions 
 - oop 
 - asynchronous programming 



This overly simplifies assumptions of livestock grazing potential.

**The point of this exercise is to focus on the core concepts within Go**
